Thank you for your interest in the Early Learning STEM Australia (ELSA) Pilot. 
To apply, please fill out the details of your preschool. 
Please note, by preschool we mean a preschool or kindergarten program for the year before school. 
This includes programs within a long day care centre, a school, or a community/stand-alone preschool.

Before you fill out this form, please have the following information ready
+ Service approval number and provider approval number
+ Overall NQS rating
+ Optional: Any details about the tablet devices (i.e. iPad, Android) at your preschool, such as make, model and year purchased

Applications are open until 11:00 pm AEST 10 April 2017. After applications close, we will select one hundred preschools for 
the Pilot to reflect preschool diversity across Australia. Selections will be announced in August 2017.
